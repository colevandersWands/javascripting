# Methoding

So far we've taken a deep look inside programming & JavaScript while using a minimal amount of javascript's powerful built-in features. This lesson is a chance to explore the best of what JS has to offer before moving on to Solution Design where these tools will shine.

(i don't know we need to write extra exercises for this. it will be a one-day pitstop before sol-des where they will get plenty of practice with the native methods. and the js.info links below are very good and have exercises at the bottom of each topic)
